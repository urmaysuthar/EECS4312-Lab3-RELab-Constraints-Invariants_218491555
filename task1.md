1. How should the system identify a patient, and are there any rules about what makes a patient identifier valid or invalid?

2. How should medications be identified in the system, and will the system work with free text names or only with a predefined list of medications?

3. What information must be provided when a medication is dispensed, and are there any fields that are optional or can be left empty?

4. How should the system decide whether a dose value is acceptable, and what should happen if the dose is zero, negative, or not given in milligrams?

5. How should the system determine the maximum allowed daily dose for a medication, and where should this information come from?

6. How should the system behave if a user attempts to dispense more medication than the maximum daily dose allows?

7. How does the system define “the same day” when checking whether a patient has already received a specific medication, and how should this be tracked?

8. What should the system do if a patient is dispensed the same medication more than once in a single day, and should this be blocked or only flagged as a warning?
